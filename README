About:
======
I wanted something that would provide an easy CLI interface to feeding an
icecast2 server.  Icecast2 only takes oggs as input.  

shoutr 

I. Prerequisites:
=================

- libshout (2.2.2)
- ruby-shout # gem install ruby-shout
  this won't actually work until ruby-shout gem is updated
- mpg123
  reads mp3 files to spit into oggenc
- vorbis-tools
  provides oggenc 

II. Setup:
==========


III. Usage:
===========

Just throw a pile of music files in the command line and it will stream
them to your configured location.  Using mpg123 and oggenc it will convert
mp3 files on the fly to ogg.

$ shoutr /path/to/some/music/files/*

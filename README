About:
======
I wanted something that would provide an easy CLI interface to feeding an
icecast2 server.  Icecast2 only takes oggs as input.  

enter shoutr 

I. Prerequisites:
=================

- An Icecast2 server to point at (not included in shoutr)
- libshout-2.x 
  centos/fedora: yum install libshout libshout-devel
- ruby-shout   # gem install ruby-shout
- mpg123 # reads mp3 the files for piping to oggenc
  centos/fedora: yum install mpg123
- vorbis-tools # provides oggenc
  centos/fedora: yum install vorbis-tools
- id3lib
  centos/fedora: yum install id3lib
- id3lib-ruby  # gem install id3lib-ruby

II. Setup:
==========

magic fairy dust sprinkled everywhere

  $ git clone git://github.com/dayne/shoutr.git
  $ cd shoutr
  $ cp config.yml.example config.yml  # edit it and point at icecast server
  $ cd <location of your personal bin directory in your path>
    # I like  $HOME/usr/bin and have: export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/usr/bin
  $ ln -s <location of shoutr> .
  
III. Usage:
===========

Just throw a pile of music files in the command line and it will stream
them to your configured location.  Using mpg123 and oggenc it will convert
mp3 files on the fly to ogg.

$ shoutr /path/to/some/music/files/*

Run it in daemon mode for much more fun.  Allows you to shoutr various files 
and have them inserted into the damon's queue.

$ shoutr -d
